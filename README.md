# SQL_PROJECT
This project showcases my skills in SQL through a series of real-world data exploration and query tasks. The goal was to work with structured data using various SQL operations like SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, subqueries, and aggregate functions to extract meaningful insights.

I worked on a relational database consisting of multiple tables, designed to simulate a practical scenario—such as a sales, employee, or customer dataset. I wrote and tested queries to answer analytical questions, identify trends, and solve business problems using SQL logic.

The project includes:

Data cleaning and filtering techniques

Use of inner and outer joins to combine tables

Subqueries for nested logic

Aggregations using SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.

Conditions using WHERE, IN, BETWEEN, and LIKE

Creating views for reusable queries

This hands-on work helped me understand the structure of databases, how to write optimized queries, and how SQL can be used to drive data-driven decisions. The queries are written to be clean, readable, and efficient—making this a great example of my ability to handle backend data logic.

I created this project to strengthen my database skills and prepare for roles that involve data analysis, backend development, or working with big data tools.
